# <Module 2 Challenge: Professional Portfolio>

## Description

For this project, my goal was to create a professional portfolio where I can showcase my recent projects.
I wanted to do this, so potential employers can have a chance to review some of my past projects during the hiring process.
Through completing this project, I reinforced some of what I've learned about CSS and creating responsive web apps.
